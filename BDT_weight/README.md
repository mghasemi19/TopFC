# Machine Learning classifiers
In addition to cut-and-count approach which is really typical in HEP analysis, we can make benefit of ML classifiers to identificate the
signal and backgrounds. There are several ML models which can be used such as neural network, random forest, boosted decision trees, etc. 
Models need to have high accuracy in signal-background discrimination and not suffering from overfitting.
