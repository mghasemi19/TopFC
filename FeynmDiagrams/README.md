# How to draw Feynman Diagrams in Latex
There are several packages can be used to draw simple and complex Feynman diagrams. ATLAS and [CMS](https://github.com/CMS-SUS-XPAG/SUSYDiagrams) developed specific packages for SUSY analyses which can be easily edited with the suitable one and then compile the diagram in the current folder by running:
```
./compile.py yourSUSYfile.tex
```

Another Latex package, feynMF is free software you can redistribute/modify it to draw all types of Feynman diagrams. This CMS [wiki](https://wiki.physik.uzh.ch/cms/latex:feynman#diffractive_proton-proton_collisions) page shows some of the basics of making Feynman diagrams in LaTeX with the feynMF/feynMP package.
